## 🧠 Project Description

This project is part of the **DSP391m** course/project, focusing on deep learning and AI model development. The goal is to train and evaluate a AI model using the provided dataset and source code, and optionally fine-tune using the pretrained weights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- (Add libraries if needed: e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.)

## 📦 Pretrained Weights

- File: `Weights_DSP391m`
- Usage: Load this file into your model for evaluation or fine-tuning.

## 🖥️ Demo App

- The `Demo/` folder contains an interactive app for visualizing model predictions and Grad-CAM heatmaps on chest X-ray images.

## 📊 Dataset

- Located in the `Dataset/` folder.
